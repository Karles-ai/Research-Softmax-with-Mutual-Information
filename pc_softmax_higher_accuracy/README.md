# PC Softmax Higher Accuracy

This repository demonstrates that Probability Correct (PC) softmax
can improve accuracy of neural network classifiers. We show two 
datasets: MNIST and CUB-200-2011. They are summarised in different
directories, as naming suggests. For details, please dive into 
either directory.
