# InfoCAM: Informative Class Activation Map

In this repository, we propose InfoCAM: informative class activation
map. Such activation map bridges the traditional class activation
map (CAM) with information theory. We demonstrate that infoCAM can 
achieve higher accuracy than CAM for weakly supervised object 
localisation (WSOL). Our implementation includes two datasets: 
CUB-200-2011 and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively. For details, please dive into 
either directory.
